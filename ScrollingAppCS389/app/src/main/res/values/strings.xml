        \n\n\nWhen I was a young boy\n
        I was living for the moment\n
        The world was wide open\n
        I had every choice\n
        But with so many choices\n
        I just didn\'t know what to do now\n
        All I say is just forget it\n
        If you tell me I\'ll regret it\n
        Just let it be what it is\n
        \'Cause it\'s so easy to say\n
        \n
        If I knew yesterday what I know today\n
        Where would I be tomorrow\n
        I won\'t let my soul slide away\n
        I\'d do whatever it take\n
        \'Cause this time\'s only borrowed\n
        \n
        I got one life\, one life\, one life\n
        And I\'m gonna live it\n
        I got one life\, one life\, one life\n
        And I\'m gonna live it right\n
        \n

        My daddy sat me down\n
        He said \"Son\, it\'s probably time to start making some plans\"\n
        And I said \"No\, not right now\"\n
        With so many choices\n
        I just didn\'t know what to do now\n
        All I say is just forget it\n
        If you tell me I\'ll regret it\n
        Just let it be what it is\n
        \'Cause it\'s so easy to say\n
        \n
        If I knew yesterday what I know today\n
        Where would I be tomorrow\n
        I won\'t let my soul slide away\n
        I\'d do whatever it takes\n
        \'Cause this time\'s only borrowed\n
        \n
        I got one life\, one life\, one life\n
        And I\'m gonna live it\n
        I got one life\, one life\, one life\n
        And I\'m gonna live it right\n
        \n
        You say the more you think\n
        You know what\'s right\n
        The less you do\n
        What you feel inside\n
        So I won\'t pretend that I always know\n
        I just follow my heart wherever it goes\n
        And I may not always get it right\n
        But at least I\'m living \'cause I\'ve only got this\n
        \n
        One life\, one life\, one life\n
        I\'ve got this one life\n
        \n
        If I knew yesterday what I know today\n
        Where would I be tomorrow\n
        I won\'t let my soul slide away\n
        I\'d do whatever it takes\n
        \'Cause this time\'s only borrowed\n
        \n
        I got one life\, one life\, one life\n
        And I\'m gonna live it\n
        I got one life\, one life\, one life\n
        And I\'m gonna live it right\n
        \n
        When I\'m an old man\n
        Hope I\'ll be rocking in my chair\n
        Smiling to myself\n
        I\'ll tell my baby girl\n
        You only got one life\n
        So make sure you live it right\n
        \n
